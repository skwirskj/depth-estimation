# 442-depth-estimation
This repo contains code from my group's project from the EECS 442: Computer Vision course at the University of Michigan. We designed a machine learning model to estimate the depth in an image.
Attached is our final report and findings. [442_Depth_Final_Report_Copy_.pdf](https://github.com/skwirskj/442-depth-estimation/files/8734729/442_Depth_Final_Report_Copy_.pdf)
